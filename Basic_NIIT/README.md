## CSS
Cascading style sheets, or CSS, defines how HTML elements are to be displayed using certain rules. A CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block includes a property name and a value separated by a colon. The declaration block may contain one or more declarations separated by semi-colons.
Three ways to syyle an HTML element: inline style, embedded or internal style (defined in the head section of an HTML page within a style element.) and external style
CSS selectors - ID (#idname), class (.classname), type (div, span etc) and attribute selector
